Selecting a movie poster shows the user a couple of details about the selected movie.

## Running The App
The app requires an API key from (https://www.themoviedb.org). You will need an account.
If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.
In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. 
You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. 
Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.
Once you have it, open the `gradle.properties` file and paste your API key in `API_KEY` variable.
